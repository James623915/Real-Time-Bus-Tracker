# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
Using JavaScript and CSS on a web page. Most events happen on the DOM. While moving the mouse, those eyes follow the its direction. 
## Description
This project helps me learn how to create a web page with two eyes that are able to follow my mouse movement. JAvaScript and CSS skills play an important role to create this dynamic experience.
