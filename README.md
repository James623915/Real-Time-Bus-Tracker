# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
Clicking on the "Show Stops between MIT and Harvard tab". You will see a marker moving from one bus stop to the next.
## Description
Manipulating Mapbox to work with DOM in JavaScript. The mapboxgl JavaScript library is part of Mapbox environment. Therefore I can add a marker or many markers. Also I can make a marker moving from one bus stop to the next on the map.
## How to run
Clone or download Real-Time-Bus-Tracker repository and open on the index.html file on your computer. Or click here for <a href="https://james623915.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/">Live Demo.</a>
## Roadmap of future improvement
I am planning to improve my eye project by making those eyes blinking while the mouse stops moving.
